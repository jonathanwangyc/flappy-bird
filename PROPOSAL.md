## Project Goal
For the final project, I would like to try implement my version of the famous game, flappy bird. I've never made a game 
using any coding language from scratch on my own, and I feel like this is the best opportunity for it. First, I just 
learned how cinder works from previous mp assignments, and it allows me to create the UI for my game. Next, I feel like 
I'm equipped with all the knowledge needed to finish the project, and being able to solve the challenges I might face 
during the implementation. My biggest motivation for this project is to create the game with my own design and logic.

## Predicted Timeline
- Week 1
  - Finish the implementation of most of the basic functionalities(generating random pillars, moving flappy bird, background).
  - Complete the test cases for the class/functions I created.

- Week 2
  - Finish the implementation of all functionalities(game terminate conditions, falling animation).
  - Being able to update the window to show a complete run of the game.
  - Start testing for the new functions.

- Week 3
  - Create a starting window that display the instruction of the game.
  - Create an ending window that display the score of previous run.
  - Finish all the functionalities and complete the test cases.
  - Implement and test the stretch goals based on the time remained.

## Stretch Goals
- Adding display for the highest score and current score while the game is playing.
- Improve the graphics of the objects(bird, pillars, background) to make it looks more realistic.
- Adding different game mode options(increased pillar count, increased moving speed).
